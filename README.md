# Voyager
>  A travel app for finding new experiences in far-flung places 

Voyager is your one-stop shop for planning your dream trip itinerary! Plan a solo adventure or bring a few of your friends in to plan something together, and let our proprietary AI suggestions guide you towards interesting adventures that are off the beaten path. You'll never have another boring vacation again!

## Installing / Getting started

To start the frontend server, run the following commands: 

```shell
npm run dev
```

As the Postgres instance is hosted on Render, there is no need to spin up a separate Node server for the backend.

### Initial Configuration

In order to update your local dependencies to their latest versions, simply run:

```shell
npm install
```

## Developing

In order to get started as a developer on Voyager, simply clone the project to your local environment and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/UrbanWandererLabs/Voyager.git
cd ~/[your local dev directory]/Voyager
npm install
```
